# Robot-Pet-Feeder
The Robot Pet Feeder is an Internet of Things project created to automatically watch and feed pets from a remote interface (Web or Phone). The project is powered by a Raspberry Pi B+ that utilizes a high-torque motor to turn a hopper to automatically dispense food on command, or on a scheduled basis. 

This project is currently in progress and will be updated over time.

- Raspberry Pi B+
- 2 Channel Relay
- 12v 10RPM High-Torque Motor
- 12v 2.5a PSU
- 3mm to 6mm Motor Coupler 
- 1.6L Hopper

## Stack used
